The GW4208A RAM expansion card provides the 
Apple II, II+, and IIe with 128 kB of 
Language Card and Saturn-compatible 
expansion memory. 


Low-Power, SRAM-Based Design
----------------------------------------
Thanks to a modern, low-power design, 
RAM2GS II uses a maximum of 0.1 watts when idle
(20 mA @ 5V) and 0.2W in active use (40 mA @ 5V). 
Unlike other Apple II expansion RAM cards, which are 
built with vintage asynchronous DRAM chips, 
RAM2GS II uses modern SRAM. This design allows for 
low power consumption and improved reliability 
over other memory cards using 15+ year old chips. 


Ecologically Friendly, Gold-Plated PCB
----------------------------------------
GW4208A features a lead-free, ENIG gold-plated 
PCB and is fully EU RoHS-compliant. 
All units are tested extensively before shipment. 
Only new parts are used to build GW4208A, 
and all GW4208A cards are manufactured in our 
semi-automated facility in Columbus, Ohio, 
in the United States. 


Open-Source Design
----------------------------------------
GW4208A's design is fully open-source. 
The schematics, board layouts, and 
CPLD firmware, are all freely available 
for commercial and noncommercial use.
